MyTechStore is a user-friendly iOS application created using Xcode, implemented with the UIKit framework and following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. The app serves as an interactive platform for a tech store specializing in selling mice and gamepads.

Upon launching the app, users are presented with a sleek and intuitive user interface, featuring a navigation view controller that allows seamless navigation between different screens. The navigation bar provides easy access to various sections of the app.

The main feature of MyTechStore is the product selection functionality. The app includes a table view controller that displays a list of available products, specifically mice and gamepads. Each product is presented in a visually appealing manner, showcasing relevant details such as product name, description, price, and an accompanying image.

To add a desired product to their cart, users simply need to tap on the "Add to Cart" button associated with the respective item. The cart icon in the navigation bar provides a visual indicator of the number of products added to the cart, giving users a quick overview of their current selection.
